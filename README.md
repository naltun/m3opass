# m3opass

Password manager built with M3O

## What is it?

`m3opass` is a password manager which uses M3O for generating, storing, and retrieving passwords.

### What is M3O?

[M3O](https://m3o.com) [0] is often referred to as the "open source AWS alternative". AWS, along with
its competitors, are proprietary cloud computing platforms that offer a wealth of software services
to be consumed by developers. M3O, in contrast, is fully free and open source software, and offers no
vendor lock-in, and has a transparent pricing model.

### Why use M3O?

M3O was chosen to avoid self-hosting remote infrastructure. Also, M3O is fully FOSS (free, open source
software). I love cloud computing, but I dislike the proprietary models of major cloud vendors.
